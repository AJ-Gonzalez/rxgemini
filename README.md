## Contribute to RX Gemini

You can contribute in many ways, and any help is appreciated. The easiest and best way to start is to become a user and share any feedback you have.

Here are the main project needs:

- Test coverage, ironic I know.
- Documentation on usage and setup.
- Feature requests.
- A proper logo. (I have a couple ideas but cannot draw like that)

For now I am the sole developer, however this will change in the future.

### Coding standars

Pylint, flake8, and Black Formatter.

All methods and fucntions must have docstrings.

## Notes

The RX in the name is inspired by both the RX-78-2 Mobile Suit from Gundam, and the Mazda FC Rx7 sportscar.
Gemini refers to the constellation and the NASA Program.

Be kind.
Raise hell, praise Dale.
