## Contribute to RX Gemini

You can contribute in many ways, and any help is appreciated. The easiest and best way to start is to become a user and share any feedback you have.

Here are the main project needs:

- Test coverage, ironic I know.
- Documentation on usage and setup.
- Feature requests.
- A proper logo. (I have a couple ideas but cannot draw like that)
