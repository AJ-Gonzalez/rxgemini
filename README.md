## Contribute to RX Gemini

You can contribute in many ways, and any help is appreciated. The easiest and best way to start is to become a user and share any feedback you have.

Here are the main project needs:

- Test coverage, ironic I know.
- Documentation on usage and setup.
- Feature requests.
- A proper logo. (I have a couple ideas but cannot draw like that)

For now I am the sole developer, however this will change in the future.

### Coding standars

Pylint, flake8, and Black Formatter.

All methods and fucntions must have docstrings.

If there are any dependency changes please run:

`poetry export --without-hashes --format=requirements.txt > requirements.txt`

To update the requirements for github's pylint workflow.

### Commit message standards

We use a prefix followed by a colon.

Example `feat: added smart scanner`

| Prefix | Indicates                                   |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| feat   | Adding to a feature or adding functionality |
| fix    | Bug fix or Hot Fix                          |
| docs   | Changes to Documentation, or docstrings     |
| fmt    | Formatting (no logic changed)               |
| ref    | Refactor or rework                          |

### Branch Naming Convention

`main` is the release branch, at this time the rest of the branch conventions is still being decided.

## Notes

The RX in the name is inspired by both the RX-78-2 Mobile Suit from Gundam, and the Mazda FC Rx7 sportscar.
Gemini refers to the constellation and the NASA Program.
